### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies

- **Language**: Swift
- **Framework**: SwiftUI
- **Xcode Version**: Xcode 16
- **Platform**: iOS

### üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Explore Xcode**: Gained familiarity with developer tools, the Xcode interface, and the fundamentals of SwiftUI. Built a simple "Hello, SwiftUI" app to get started.
  
- **Views, Structures, and Properties**: Learned how to customize views, structures, and properties in SwiftUI. Developed simple interfaces using SwiftUI's flexible and reusable component system.
  
- **Layout and Style**: Explored the principles of layout and styling in user interfaces. Learned how to create aesthetically pleasing and complex layouts using SwiftUI's declarative syntax.
  
- **Buttons and State Management**: Implemented buttons and user interaction with state management in SwiftUI. Discovered how to synchronize UI updates using properties like `@State` and `@Binding`.
  
- **Lists and Text Fields**: Learned how to work with lists and text fields to create dynamic content. Managed user input efficiently using SwiftUI's flexible form and list structures.
  
- **Custom Types and Swift Testing**: Modeled data with custom types and added functionality through Swift Testing. Integrated tests to ensure data handling and app logic were functioning correctly.
  
- **Models and Persistence**: Developed skills in saving data and managing persistence in SwiftUI apps. Understood how to efficiently store and retrieve data.
  
- **Navigation, Editing, and Relationships**: Implemented navigation through sample data, as well as create, update, and delete operations. Learned how to manage relationships between different data entities.
  
- **Observation and Shareable Data Models**: Completed a game logic using observable and shareable data models. This section helped in understanding how data can flow and be shared across various views.

### üí° What I Learned

During this tutorial series, I acquired the following skills and knowledge:

- Mastered the SwiftUI framework to build modern and interactive UIs.
- Learned the importance of state management using tools like `@State`, `@Binding`, and `@ObservedObject` to handle reactive UI updates.
- Understood how to manage and persist data effectively in iOS applications.
- Gained experience in designing user interfaces with attention to layout, style, and user interaction.
- Enhanced my understanding of data modeling, navigation, and relationship handling in apps.
- Acquired testing skills to ensure app functionality and logic are properly implemented and bug-free.
- Completed practical projects that demonstrate the use of custom data types, dynamic lists, and advanced navigation techniques.
